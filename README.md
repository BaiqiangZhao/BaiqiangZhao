My name is Baiqiang Zhao. I am from China. 
I am interested in learning to build cool stuff.
My favorite hobby is playing online computer games with my friends and I like to play music with my friends as well. 
I learned to play piano in elementary school and high school. I love to play accompaniment for my friends.
